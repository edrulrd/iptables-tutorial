Introduction
------------
The Iptables-tutorial needs to be built into viewable documents from the
DocBook SGML source files before reading. This README will mainly describe how to
build the different viewable document types. The Makefile has support for
building HTML, PDF and PS formats, as well as the source tar ball.

The build process is not trivial, however, it has been successfully run recently on
current releases of CentOS 9 Stream and Debian 12.  Please see below.

Build requirements
------------------
The generated files were successfully built on the following systems with
the indicated installed packages which are used within the Makefile.

CentOS 9 Stream steps:
1   - dnf install netpbm
2   - dnf install netpbm-progs                      # to get the giftopnm and pnmtopng programs
3a  - dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm # the EPEL Repo contains ImageMagick
3b  - dnf install GraphicsMagick                    # (step may not be needed, as the convert program was not installed by it.)
3c  - dnf install ImageMagick                       # to get the convert program
4   - dnf install docbook-style-dsssl               # to get the collateindex.pl program
5   - dnf install docbook-utils                     # to get the jw program
6   - dnf install texlive-jadetex                   # to get the jadetex program
7   - dnf install texlive-latex-recommendedpackages # to get some extra latex fonts
8   - dnf install texlive-epstopdf                  # to get the repstopdf program

Debian 12 steps:
1   - apt install netpbm                            # to get giftopnm and pnmtopng programs
2   - apt install imagemagick                       # to get the convert program
2a  - # the imagemagick policy.xml file in /etc/ImageMagick-6/ needed to be adjusted to get around an error message
#   - # See https://en.linuxportal.info/tutorials/troubleshooting/how-to-fix-errors-from-imagemagick-imagick-conversion-system-security-policy
3   - apt install docbook-dsssl                     # to get the collateindex.pl program and stylesheets for docbook
4   - apt install docbook-utils                     # to get the jw program
5   - # The SGML docbook 4.1 DTD does not seem to be installed in Debian 12.  This was a bear to install, but this worked:
5a  - mkdir -p /usr/local/share/docbk41; wget -nc http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/4.1/docbk41.zip --output-document=/usr/local/share/docbk41/docbk41.zip
5b  - unzip /usr/local/share/docbk41/docbk41.zip -d /usr/local/share/docbk41 # unzip the file into the same folder
5c  - update-catalog --add  /etc/sgml/catalog /usr/local/share/docbk41/docbook.cat # insert the docbook.cat file into the central catalog in /etc/sgml
5d  - update-catalog --update-super                 # update the super-catalog
6   - apt install texlive-font-utils                # get the repstopdf program
7   - apt install rsync                             # to get the rsync program

With these installed, issuing the make command (as a regular user) creates the desired documentation files.

Installation notes
------------------
If you have all the above installed, you should be ok by doing the 
following:

$ make all

This should build the PDF, PS, HTML and SRC targets.


If you want to build the portuguese or spanish translation, do the following:

$ make portuguese
or
$ make spanish

The documents are then built and saved in the 
iptables-tutorial/portuguese/ or iptables-tutorial/spanish/ directories. If you want to build _everything_
you could do:

$ make site

This builds everything (including portuguese and spanish translations) and puts them in
the iptables-tutorial/html/ directory. 

If you have trouble with the build procedure, avoid contacting me unless
you have a real good explanation for using the sources instead of the
prebuilt versions at http://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html :).

Enjoy!
