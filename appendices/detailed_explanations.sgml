   <para>
To list your currently active rule-set you run a special option to the
<command>iptables</command> command, which we have discussed briefly previously
in the <link linkend="howaruleisbuilt"
endterm="howaruleisbuilt.title"></link> chapter. This would look like the
following:
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>iptables -L</command>
   </para>

   <para>
This command should list your currently active rule-set, and translate
everything possible to a more readable form. For example, it will
translate all the different ports according to the
<filename>/etc/services</filename> file as well as <systemitem>DNS</systemitem>
all the IP addresses to get <systemitem>DNS</systemitem> records instead. The
latter can be a bit of a problem though. For example, it will try to resolve
<systemitem>LAN</systemitem> IP addresses, i.e.
<computeroutput>192.168.1.1</computeroutput>, to something useful.
<computeroutput>192.168.0.0/16</computeroutput> is a private range though and
should not resolve to anything and the command will seem to hang while resolving
the IP. To get around this problem we would do something like the following:

   </para>

   <para>
    <command>iptables -L -n</command>
   </para>

   <para>
Another thing that might be interesting is to see a few statistics about
each policy, rule and chain. We could get this by adding the verbose
flag. It would then look something like this:
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>iptables -L -n -v</command>
   </para>

   <para>
Don't forget that it is also possible to list the nat and mangle tables. This 
is done with the -t switch, like this:
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>iptables -L -t nat</command>
   </para>

   <para>
There are also a few files that might be interesting to look at in the
<filename>/proc</filename> file system. For example, it might be interesting
to know what connections are currently in the conntrack table. This table
contains all the different connections currently tracked and serves as a basic
table so we always know what state a connection currently is in. This table
can't be edited and even if it was possible, it would be a bad idea. To
see the table you can run the following command:

   </para>

   <para>
    <command>cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack | less</command>
or, if installed, issue the command:
    <command>conntrack -L | less</command>
   </para>

  <note>
   <para>
Newer kernels use "nf" files instead.  So the replacement command would be
    <command>cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack | less</command>
   </para>

   <para>
The output can be made more readable by distributing the output into columns
    <command>cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack | column -t | less</command>
   </para>
  </note>

   <para>
The above command will show all currently tracked connections even though
it might be a bit hard to understand everything.
   </para>

   <para> If at some point you screw up your <command>iptables</command>,
there are actually commands to flush them, so you don't have to reboot.
I've actually gotten this question a couple times by now so I thought I'd
answer it right here. If you added a rule in error, you might just change
the <command>-A</command> parameter to <command>-D</command> in the line
you added in error. <command>iptables</command> will find the erroneous
line and erase it for you, in case you've got multiple lines looking
exactly the same in the chain, it erases the first instance it finds
matching your rule. If this is not the wanted behavior you might try to
use the <command>-D</command> option as <command>iptables -D INPUT
10</command> which will erase the 10th rule in the
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> chain.
   </para>

   <para> There are also instances where you want to flush a whole chain,
in this case you might want to run the <command>-F</command> option. For
example, <command>iptables -F INPUT</command> will erase the whole
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> chain, though, this will not change
the default policy, so if this is set to
<systemitem>DROP</systemitem> you'll block the whole
<systemitem>INPUT</systemitem> chain if used as above. To reset
the chain policy, do as you did to set it to
<systemitem>DROP</systemitem>, for example <command>iptables -P
INPUT ACCEPT</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
   I have made a <link linkend="rcflush-iptablestxt" 
endterm="rcflush-iptablestxt.title"></link> (available as an appendix as well) 
that will flush and reset your <command>iptables</command> that you might 
consider using while setting up your <filename>rc.firewall.txt</filename> file 
properly. One thing though; if you start mucking around in the 
<systemitem>mangle</systemitem> table, this script will not erase those, it is 
rather simple to add the few lines needed to erase those but I have not added 
those here since the <systemitem>mangle</systemitem> table is not used in my
<filename>rc.firewall.txt</filename> script so far.
