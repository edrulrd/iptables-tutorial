    <para>
This section was added so that corporations may have their products tested and
added to this tutorial. If you are a company and would like to have your
products tested and reviewed in this section, you are more than welcome to
contact the author through usual channels (see the top of this tutorial). Mind
you that this section is not the definite place to look for product testing.
It is rather a try to offer something to all of the corporate producers of
Linux based products, and who contribute to the development of
<systemitem>GNU/Linux</systemitem> software. 
    </para>

    <para>
If someone feels that their product has been badly reviewed here, they are
more than welcome to contact the author for a more complete description of the
problem, or to have their revised product possibly re-reviewed with newer
firmwares etc. This might change, since the author doesn't know how popular
this review section will be.

      <para>
In short, the <link linkend="ingate">InGate Firewall 1200</link> is a
commercial firewall product. To be fairly honest, they are definitely in the
pricey range and not for most/any home-users. However, you get what you pay
for, and this is an excellent product in other words. Before we go any
further, it should be noted that the InGate firewalls are hardware and
software solutions. Basically it is a very small computer running a modified
Linux kernel. Of course, you will pretty much never see that it is actually
running Linux (except for naming conventions in the interface, and so forth).
      </para>
      
      <para>
A lot of effort has been put into creating a nicely advanced web interface to
configure and administrate the firewall from. The <link linkend="ingate">InGate 
1200 firewall</link> has 2 10/100 Mbps Ethernet connectors and the larger 
versions has more (up to 6 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet connectors and 2 mini Gbic 
ports).
      </para>
      
      <para>
They also have <link linkend="sip">SIP</link> traversal support and <link
linkend="sip">SIP</link> support for Internet telephony, and built in support
for <link linkend="tls">TLS</link>. The 1200 came with 2 SIP user licenses,
and the number differs depending on which firewall/SIParator you buy. The user
interface for handling <link linkend="sip">SIP</link> is excellent and very
intuitive, though it does use quite a lot of tech heavy jargon. It might be a
good idea to keep the manual around in other words, which might actually be
true whatever you are doing on this machine, for multiple reasons really. The
manual is excellently written, and it might also be very hard to understand
the interface before you get used to the highly technical language they have
chosen to use. The manual is 250+ pages and available both in English and
Swedish as of this writing, and as I've already said, very well written.

      <para>
On top of this, the <link linkend="ingate">InGate</link> firewalls has <link 
linkend="rfc2401">ipsec</link> based <systemitem>VPN</systemitem> and
<systemitem>QoS</systemitem> support. The <link linkend="rfc2401">ipsec</link> 
based <systemitem>VPN</systemitem> should be interoperable with all other <link 
linkend="rfc2401">ipsec</link> implementations, including "Road Warrior" roaming. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
The device also has a very simple to setup logging facility. The machine can
either log locally, or via <systemitem>syslog</systemitem> and/or
<systemitem>mail</systemitem>. The local logging facility has exceptionally
good and fine-grained search capabilities through the logs. My only problem
with the local logging facility is that the search engine might be a little
bit too slow. This is actually my main and only concern with the whole
firewall, the whole user interface is a bit slow, and sometimes it jumps to
the main page after editing. This might have been fixed in newer versions
however. All things considered, this isn't a bad fault at all, and it could
have been much worse than a slow user interface/weird linking.
      </para>
      
      <para>
The first time I tried the test machine that I got, I borked the configuration
pretty badly (I.e., I inverted the interfaces among other things). Because of
this, my original setup time was around 4-5 hours before I could reach the
Internet. If I hadn't done these initial errors, the original configuration
time would probably have been around 1 hour or so. Of course, this can only be
expected when using a new and unknown (to you) interface. 
      </para>
      
      <para>
The default values are very good. In other words, they are non-existent except
for the most basic options. The first thing you do, is to set the IP address of 
the device via a "magic ping" (set the device mac address to an IP address and 
then ping the IP address - this must be done locally). The opposite ethernet 
port is by default turned off until you turn it on, and no configuration
except the most basic is done by the InGate developers (log groups and so on).
      </para>
      
      <para>
In conclusion, this is one of the best commercial firewalls I have seen on the 
market. The only real flaw is that the user interface  is a tad slow and that 
the device is rather high priced. The pros of the device far far outweighs most 
cost issues that any company would have, and the simplicity of not having to 
scratch install a system of your own could actually make this a simpler and 
cheaper device to set up than a scratch installed system for most companies - 
especially if the process consists of a large quantity of firewalls and the 
administrators are experienced in other InGate products. Of course, this is 
always the case I assume!

      <title>What's next?</title>

      <para>
This chapter has discussed some different commercial firewalling products
based on iptables, netfilter and linux. This list is much, much longer than
what you have seen in this chapter. However, for me to try them out, I must
have something to test to begin with. If you know of a product that you think
I should have in this section, why not either give me access to it for a
couple of days, or call the producer and see if they wouldn't like to send me
a sample/demo copy?
      </para>

      <para>
Well, this was the last chapter. What's left is just the different appendices.
Some of them contains some rather interesting information that didn't quite
fit into any specific chapter, and others are just generic tables, and so
forth. If you have any further interest in the area, there is tons and tons of
material to read, and why not join the mailing lists available at the netfilter
website? Or why not start developing for iptables and netfilter? I hope you
have enjoyed reading this document and that you have been able to set some of
it to the real world test.
