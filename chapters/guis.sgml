One side of iptables and netfilter that we haven't looked at very much yet, is 
the graphical user interfaces that are available for iptables and netfilter. 
One of the biggest problems with this is that netfilter is a very complex and 
flexible setup, that can perform the strangest of tasks. For this reason, 
it can become a very daunting task to create a <systemitem>GUI</systemitem>
for netfilter.
    </para>
    
    <para>
Several persons and organisations have tried to create
<systemitem>GUI's</systemitem> for netfilter and iptables, and some have
succeeded better than others, while others have given up after some time. All
have different reasoning behind their tries as well, so it isn't an easy task
to show them all. However, this chapter is a small compilation of some of the
<systemitem>GUI's</systemitem> for iptables and netfilter that may be worth
looking at. Suggestions on others to add are always welcome.

Firewall Builder, or simply <systemitem>fwbuilder</systemitem>, is an extremely versatile and powerful 
tool that can be used to build your own firewalls, or to maintain several 
firewalls for that matter. It can be used to create policies for several 
different types of firewalls, including <systemitem>iptables</systemitem>
(Linux 2.4 and 2.6), <systemitem>ipfilter</systemitem> 
(freebsd, netbsd, etc), <systemitem>openbsd</systemitem>
<systemitem>pf</systemitem>, and, a module that must be bought, 
<systemitem>Cisco PIX</systemitem>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
<systemitem>Fwbuilder</systemitem> has, as you can see, a very big audience
and is well taken care of and continues to be developed. It is run on a
separate host system, where you create the policy files, and then copy them
over and run them on the target system. It is able to handle everything from
very simple rulesets to large and rather complicated ones. It has extensive
abilities to handle different versions and installations of
<systemitem>iptables</systemitem>, by configuration of which targets/matches
are available on each host system, etcetera. The end result may be saved in an
xml file, or a system parsable configuration file (e.g., the real firewall
scripts).

Turtle Firewall is an excellent, yet simpler kind of user interface to 
iptables. It is integrated in something called webmin (a web administration 
interface). It is fairly basic, and neither as complex nor able to handle as 
complex changes as the fwbuilder package, but it is more than able to handle 
most simpler firewalls, as well as some more advanced ones as well.
      </para>
      
      <para>
One big advantage with Turtle Firewall is the fact that it is web-based, and 
hence can be remotely controlled in a totally different manner than with 
fwbuilder and most other tools. Of course, it also adds more of a security risk 
since webmin is a separate extra service running on the firewall itself.

The latest public version of the Integrated Secure Communications System, or shortly ISCS,
version 0.5, was released according to
<ulink url="http://iscs.sourceforge.net/">http://iscs.sourceforge.net/</ulink>.
circa April 2013.
ISCS integrates several functionalities into a single suite
of administration and management user interface.
Being able to fully configure all your
firewalls from a centralized point using a single GUI, including VPN's, VLAN's, 
Tunnels, sysctl's, etcetera.
      </para>
      
      <para>
The main attack angle that the developer(s) of ISCS has, is to simplify 
management and administration and to remove tedious work for the 
administrators, so to save as much work hours as possible for the 
administrators. This is done by putting together policies, and then the 
programs creates the rulesets and "pushes" them out to the "enforcements 
points" (e.g., firewalls, proxies, etcetera). The administrator doesn't 
actually "write" or "click" together the rulesets, just simply put together 
policies that are then enforced by ISCS.
      </para>
      
      <para>
This tool isn't finished yet, as of writing this. However, I have been in touch 
with the main developer of this project before, and this is indeed a very large 
project. When it is finished, I believe this will be one of the best tools on 
the market. Of course, time can only tell, but it is well worth mentioning 
here. You can find the ISCS project over at <ulink 
url="http://iscs.sourceforge.net/">http://iscs.sourceforge.net/</ulink>. 
      </para>
      
      <note>
        <para>
The main developer, John Sullivan, of ISCS has specifically asked me to ask 
people to join his development efforts. The project is very big, and he would 
definitely like as much help with the project as possible. If you are able to 
help, you are, in other words, more than welcome.

IPMenu is a very able program, yet simple to operate and not too demanding on 
resources nor bandwidth. It is a console based program, so it works perfect over 
an SSH connection for example. It works perfectly on machines running over a 
simple and old modem as well.
      </para>
      
      <para>
As you can see from the screenshot, it is able to handle all iptables 
functionality, including filtering, mangling and nating. It is also able to 
handle routing tables and bandwidth shaping and to save and restore rulesets. 
You can add new rules directly into the currently running iptables script 
easily, and handle all of the different tables. Including adding and removing 
custom chains.

      <para>
As you can see from the screenshot above, the program is rather basic, but 
still able to handle most situations rather well. And first of all, it is very 
simple, and can be used for remote administration simply enough, and since it 
runs on top of ssh via a standard console, it should also be fairly secure. You

Easy Firewall Generator is another interesting development when it comes to 
iptables and netfilter. Basically, Easy Firewall Generator is a PHP webpage 
where you specify options and specifics of your firewall, and once all of the 
configurations are done, you click a button, and the webpage spits out an 
iptables ruleset that you can utilize.
      </para>
      
      <para>
The script contains all the basic rules, and more specific ones to contain 
strange patterns in packets. It also contains specific IP sysctl changes that 
may be needed, loads necessary modules, et cetera. The whole ruleset is also 
written in a redhat init.d format.

In this chapter we have looked closer at what can be done with some different 
graphical user interfaces, and other user interfaces as well. Note that there 
are several more user interfaces around on the market. This chapter has mainly 
given you an idea of the different types of firewall administration interfaces 
around on the market. Most of them are open source and free to use, while some 
will cost a bit of money to get full support or functionality from.
